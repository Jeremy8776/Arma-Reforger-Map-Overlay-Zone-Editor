# Getting Started

## 1. Accessing the Editor
You can use ARMOZE directly from your browser without installing anything:
[**Launch Editor**](https://jeremy8776.github.io/Arma-Reforger-Map-Overlay-Zone-Editor/)

Alternatively, you can clone the repository and run it locally:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jeremy8776/Arma-Reforger-Map-Overlay-Zone-Editor.git
# Open index.html in your browser
```

## 2. Loading Your Map
The first step is to get your game map into the editor.

1.  **Export Map Image**: In Arma Reforger Workbench or World Editor, take a high-resolution top-down screenshot or export the map texture.
    *   Supported formats: `.EDDS` (Texture), `.JPG`, `.PNG`
2.  **Import to Editor**:
    *   Drag and drop the file anywhere onto the editor canvas.
    *   Or click the large **Choose File** button.
3.  **Automatic Fitting**: The editor will automatically center and fit your image to the view.

## 3. Navigation Controls
Move around your map with ease:

| Action | Control |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Pan** | Hold `Space` + Left Click & Drag <br> OR Click Middle Mouse Button & Drag |
| **Zoom** | Mouse Wheel Scroll |
| **Fit View** | Press `F` key (Reset view to center) |
