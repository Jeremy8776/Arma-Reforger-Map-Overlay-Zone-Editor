# Project Management

ARMOZE allows you to save your work and resume later. This is crucial for large projects or collaborative map design.

## Saving a Project
1.  Click the **Save Project** button (Floppy Disk icon 💾).
2.  A `.json` file (e.g., `map_project.json`) will be downloaded to your computer.
3.  This file contains:
    *   All your zones and their coordinates.
    *   Zone properties (colors, types, names).
    *   Map scaling settings.

## Loading a Project
1.  Click the **Load Project** button (Folder Open icon 📂).
2.  Select your previously saved `.json` file.
3.  The editor will restore your entire session exactly as it was.

> **Note**: The project file does *not* contain the map image itself (to keep file sizes small). You will need to re-load the map image separately if you have refreshed the page, but your zones will overlay correctly on top of it.
